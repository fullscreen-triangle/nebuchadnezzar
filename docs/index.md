# Nebuchadnezzar: Hierarchical Probabilistic Electric Circuit System for Biological Simulation

## Overview

**Nebuchadnezzar** is an advanced systems biology framework that models intracellular processes through hierarchical probabilistic electrical circuits, fundamentally reimagining biological computation by using ATP as the foundational rate unit instead of time. The framework integrates quantum mechanical principles with biological systems, enabling unprecedented simulation accuracy and theoretical insights into living systems.

## Core Innovation

Traditional biological simulations rely on time-based modeling, but Nebuchadnezzar recognizes that biological systems operate on energy flow patterns, specifically ATP/ADP cycling. By restructuring simulations around ATP as the fundamental unit, the framework achieves:

- **Energy-Coherent Modeling**: All processes scale naturally with cellular energy availability
- **Quantum-Classical Integration**: Seamless bridging between quantum coherence effects and classical biological dynamics  
- **Hierarchical Circuit Organization**: Multi-scale modeling from molecular interactions to cellular networks
- **Probabilistic State Evolution**: Uncertainty quantification throughout all biological processes

## Theoretical Foundation

Nebuchadnezzar is built on six foundational theorems that revolutionize our understanding of biological computation:

1. **[Membrane Quantum Computation](theoretical-framework#membrane-quantum-computation)**: Biological membranes function as room-temperature quantum computers through Environment-Assisted Quantum Transport (ENAQT)

2. **[Universal Oscillatory Framework](theoretical-framework#universal-oscillatory-framework)**: All bounded nonlinear biological systems exhibit mathematically predictable oscillatory behavior

3. **[Entropy Reformulation](theoretical-framework#entropy-reformulation)**: Entropy becomes a manipulable quantity through probabilistic points and biological Maxwell's demons

4. **[Fire-Driven Evolutionary Consciousness](theoretical-framework#consciousness-evolution)**: Human consciousness emerged through fire exposure coupling quantum processes with information catalysis

5. **[Temporal Determinism](theoretical-framework#temporal-determinism)**: Biological optimization represents navigation toward predetermined optimal coordinates rather than creative generation

6. **[Enhanced Information Processing](theoretical-framework#information-processing)**: Biological Maxwell's demons amplify information processing capabilities beyond classical thermodynamic limits

// Run simulation with ATP-based timing
let results = system.simulate_atp_cycles(1000)?;
println!("System coherence: {:.3}", results.quantum_coherence);
