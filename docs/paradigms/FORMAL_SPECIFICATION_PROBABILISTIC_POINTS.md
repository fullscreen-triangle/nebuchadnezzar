# Formal Specification: Probabilistic Points and Resolutions

## Abstract

This document formalizes a new paradigm for text processing that treats all textual elements as inherently uncertain "Points" and all operations as probabilistic "Resolutions". Unlike traditional deterministic text processing, this system acknowledges that meaning in natural language is fundamentally probabilistic and context-dependent.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Points

A **Point** is a variable representing textual content with inherent uncertainty.

#### Definition
```
Point := {
    content: Text,
    certainty: Probability ∈ [0, 1],
    context: ContextSpace,
    temporal_state: TimeStamp
}
```

#### Properties
- **No point is 100% certain** - All textual meaning contains some degree of uncertainty
- **Points exist in probability space** - They represent distributions of possible meanings
- **Points are context-dependent** - The same textual content can yield different points in different contexts
- **Points can evolve** - Their certainty and meaning can change as more information becomes available

#### Examples
```
point₁ = {
    content: "bank",
    certainty: 0.7,
    context: "financial_document",
    temporal_state: now()
}

point₂ = {
    content: "bank", 
    certainty: 0.6,
    context: "nature_description",
    temporal_state: now()
}
```

### 2. Resolutions

A **Resolution** is a probabilistic operation that processes points along with supporting evidence to produce new probabilistic outputs.

#### Definition
```
Resolution := Function(
    primary_point: Point,
    affirmations: Set<Evidence>,
    contentions: Set<CounterEvidence>,
    context: ContextSpace
) → ProbabilisticResult
```

#### Input Components

**Primary Point**: The main textual element being processed
- Contains the core content under analysis
- Has its own inherent uncertainty

**Affirmations**: Evidence that supports certain interpretations
- Contextual clues that strengthen particular meanings
- Prior knowledge that aligns with specific interpretations
- Corroborating textual evidence

**Contentions**: Evidence that challenges or weakens certain interpretations  
- Contextual information that contradicts specific meanings
- Counter-evidence from conflicting sources
- Ambiguity indicators that increase uncertainty

#### Output: ProbabilisticResult
```
ProbabilisticResult := {
    interpretations: List<WeightedInterpretation>,
    confidence_bounds: (lower: Probability, upper: Probability),
    resolution_strength: Probability,
    remaining_uncertainty: Probability,
    evidence_synthesis: EvidenceMap
}

WeightedInterpretation := {
    meaning: InterpretedContent,
    probability: Probability,
    supporting_evidence: List<Evidence>,
    conflicting_evidence: List<CounterEvidence>
}
```

## Mathematical Foundation

### Probability Space
All operations occur within a probability space Ω where:
- Each point p ∈ Ω has an associated probability measure μ(p) ∈ [0,1]  
- Resolutions are functions R: Ω × Evidence × Context → Ω
- The total probability across all possible interpretations sums to 1

### Uncertainty Propagation
When multiple points or evidence pieces are combined:
```
Combined_Uncertainty = f(
    point_uncertainty,
    affirmation_strength,
    contention_strength,
    evidence_conflicts
)
```

Where f is a function that accounts for:
- Constructive evidence (affirmations reduce uncertainty)
- Destructive evidence (contentions increase uncertainty)  
- Evidence conflicts (contradictions increase uncertainty)
- Context coherence (consistent context reduces uncertainty)

### Resolution Strength
Each resolution has an inherent strength based on:
- Quality of evidence provided
- Coherence between affirmations and contentions
- Contextual alignment
- Historical accuracy of similar resolutions

## Operational Framework

### 1. Point Creation
```
create_point(text_content, initial_context) → Point
```
- Takes raw text and context
- Assigns initial uncertainty based on content ambiguity
- Returns a Point ready for resolution

### 2. Evidence Gathering
```
gather_affirmations(point, knowledge_base) → Set<Evidence>
gather_contentions(point, knowledge_base) → Set<CounterEvidence>
```
- Automatically or manually collect supporting/opposing evidence
- Evidence can be textual, contextual, or meta-textual

### 3. Resolution Process
```
resolve(point, affirmations, contentions, context) → ProbabilisticResult
```
- Processes all inputs through probabilistic reasoning
- Applies Bayesian updating based on evidence
- Returns weighted interpretations with confidence measures

### 4. Result Interpretation
```
extract_most_likely(result) → WeightedInterpretation
extract_all_plausible(result, threshold) → List<WeightedInterpretation>
calculate_ambiguity(result) → Probability
```

## Types of Resolutions

### 1. Semantic Resolution
**Purpose**: Determine meaning of ambiguous text
```
semantic_resolve(
    point: "bank statement",
    affirmations: ["financial context", "numerical data present"],
    contentions: ["near river mentioned"],
    context: "business_document"
) → "financial record" (p=0.89), "river documentation" (p=0.11)
```

### 2. Sentiment Resolution  
**Purpose**: Determine emotional or attitudinal content
```
sentiment_resolve(
    point: "That's interesting",
    affirmations: ["positive context", "engaged tone"],
    contentions: ["formal setting", "brief response"],
    context: "professional_email"
) → "genuine_interest" (p=0.45), "polite_dismissal" (p=0.55)
```

### 3. Intent Resolution
**Purpose**: Determine intended action or purpose
```
intent_resolve(
    point: "Could you help me with this?",
    affirmations: ["urgent tone", "specific problem context"],
    contentions: ["indirect phrasing", "casual setting"],
    context: "colleague_communication"
) → "direct_request" (p=0.7), "casual_inquiry" (p=0.3)
```

### 4. Temporal Resolution
**Purpose**: Determine time-related meaning
```
temporal_resolve(
    point: "We'll do this soon",
    affirmations: ["deadline context", "urgency indicators"],
    contentions: ["vague phrasing", "no specific timeframe"],
    context: "project_management"
) → "within_week" (p=0.4), "within_month" (p=0.5), "indefinite" (p=0.1)
```

## Evidence Types

### Affirmations (Supporting Evidence)
1. **Contextual Affirmations**
   - Domain-specific terminology present
   - Consistent thematic elements
   - Appropriate register/formality level

2. **Structural Affirmations**  
   - Grammatical patterns supporting interpretation
   - Discourse markers indicating meaning
   - Punctuation and formatting cues

3. **Semantic Affirmations**
   - Related concepts in surrounding text
   - Coherent conceptual framework
   - Logical argument structure

4. **Pragmatic Affirmations**
   - Cultural context alignment
   - Situational appropriateness
   - Speaker/writer intention indicators

### Contentions (Counter-Evidence)
1. **Contextual Contentions**
   - Mixed domain signals
   - Inconsistent terminology
   - Conflicting contextual cues

2. **Ambiguity Contentions**
   - Multiple valid interpretations available
   - Unclear referents
   - Polysemous terms present

3. **Coherence Contentions**
   - Logical inconsistencies
   - Contradictory statements
   - Incomplete information

4. **Reliability Contentions**
   - Source credibility issues
   - Historical inaccuracy
   - Contradicts established knowledge

## Implementation Philosophy

### Design Principles

1. **Uncertainty is Fundamental**: Never pretend certainty where none exists
2. **Evidence-Driven**: All conclusions must be supported by explicit evidence
3. **Context-Aware**: Same text can have different meanings in different contexts
4. **Probabilistic Throughout**: No binary true/false - everything is probabilistic
5. **Transparent Reasoning**: Show how conclusions were reached
6. **Updateable**: New evidence can change previous conclusions

### Human-Like Reasoning

This system mimics how humans actually process text:
- We consider multiple possible meanings
- We weigh evidence for and against interpretations
- We remain uncertain when evidence is unclear
- We update our understanding as more information arrives
- We consider context heavily in interpretation

## Example Workflow

### Scenario: Processing "The solution is optimal"

1. **Point Creation**
```
point = create_point("The solution is optimal", context="technical_document")
// Initial uncertainty: 0.3 (due to ambiguous terms)
```

2. **Evidence Gathering**
```
affirmations = [
    "mathematical context present",
    "optimization terminology used",
    "technical audience"
]

contentions = [
    "no specific metrics provided", 
    "subjective term 'optimal'",
    "could be business optimization vs mathematical"
]
```

3. **Resolution**
```
result = resolve(point, affirmations, contentions, "technical_document")

// Output:
interpretations = [
    {meaning: "mathematically optimal solution", probability: 0.6},
    {meaning: "best practical choice", probability: 0.3},
    {meaning: "subjective quality assessment", probability: 0.1}
]

confidence_bounds = (0.45, 0.75)
resolution_strength = 0.7
remaining_uncertainty = 0.3
```

4. **Application**
```
// For mathematical processing:
if extract_most_likely(result).meaning contains "mathematical"
    apply_mathematical_optimization_analysis()

// For uncertainty-aware display:
display("Solution optimality: " + result.confidence_bounds + " confidence")
```

## Advantages Over Traditional Approaches

1. **Honest About Uncertainty**: Acknowledges when we don't know
2. **Evidence-Based**: Conclusions are grounded in explicit reasoning
3. **Context-Sensitive**: Same text processed differently in different contexts
4. **Updatable**: Can incorporate new evidence
5. **Nuanced**: Captures subtle degrees of meaning
6. **Transparent**: Shows reasoning process
7. **Human-Like**: Reflects how humans actually understand text

## Future Research Directions

1. **Machine Learning Integration**: Train systems to better identify affirmations and contentions
2. **Context Modeling**: Develop sophisticated context representation systems
3. **Evidence Networks**: Model complex relationships between evidence pieces
4. **Temporal Dynamics**: Handle how meaning changes over time
5. **Multi-Modal**: Extend to non-textual evidence (images, audio, etc.)
6. **Collaborative Resolution**: Multiple agents contributing evidence and perspectives
7. **Meta-Resolution**: Resolutions about the quality of other resolutions

## Conclusion

This formal specification establishes a foundation for text processing that embraces uncertainty rather than hiding it. By treating text as inherently probabilistic and using evidence-based reasoning, we can build systems that more accurately reflect the complexity and nuance of human language understanding.

The key insight is that traditional deterministic text processing is fundamentally flawed because it assumes certainty where none exists. By building uncertainty into the foundation of our text processing systems, we can create more honest, nuanced, and ultimately more useful tools for working with natural language.
