# Goal System in Kwasa-Kwasa

## Overview

The Goal System is a fundamental component of Kwasa-Kwasa's metacognitive orchestration that enables writers to define, track, and achieve specific writing objectives. Unlike traditional writing tools that focus on mechanics, the Goal System understands intent and guides the writing process toward desired outcomes.

## Core Concepts

### What is a Goal?

A Goal in Kwasa-Kwasa is a computational representation of a writing intention that includes:
- **Objective**: What you want to achieve
- **Success Criteria**: How to measure achievement
- **Context**: Domain and audience considerations
- **Progress Tracking**: Current state toward completion
- **Adaptive Guidance**: Dynamic suggestions based on progress

### Goal Architecture

```turbulance
// Goal structure
struct Goal {
    id: String,
    description: String,
    success_threshold: f64,        // 0.0 to 1.0
    current_progress: f64,         // 0.0 to 1.0
    keywords: Array<String>,
    domain: String,
    audience: String,
    priority: Priority,            // Low, Medium, High, Critical
    created_at: Timestamp,
    deadline: Option<Timestamp>,
    sub_goals: Array<Goal>,
    metrics: GoalMetrics,
    status: GoalStatus            // Active, Paused, Completed, Failed
}
```

## Goal Creation and Definition

### Basic Goal Creation

```turbulance
// Simple goal creation
item goal = Goal.new("Write a clear technical tutorial", 0.8)

// Detailed goal creation
item tutorial_goal = Goal.new("Create beginner-friendly machine learning tutorial") {
    success_threshold: 0.85,
    keywords: ["tutorial", "beginner", "machine learning", "step-by-step"],
    domain: "education",
    audience: "programming beginners",
    priority: Priority.High,
    deadline: "2024-01-15"
}
```

### Goal Categories

#### Writing Quality Goals
```turbulance
item clarity_goal = Goal.new("Ensure text clarity for general audience") {
    success_threshold: 0.7,
    metrics: {
        readability_score: 65,     // Minimum Flesch-Kincaid score
        jargon_density: 0.1,       // Maximum technical terms per 100 words
        explanation_coverage: 0.9   // Percentage of technical terms explained
    }
}

item engagement_goal = Goal.new("Create engaging and compelling content") {
    success_threshold: 0.75,
    metrics: {
        attention_retention: 0.8,   // Predicted reader attention span
        emotional_resonance: 0.6,   // Sentiment and engagement scores
        narrative_flow: 0.7         // Story progression quality
    }
}
```

#### Content Structure Goals
```turbulance
item organization_goal = Goal.new("Maintain logical content organization") {
    success_threshold: 0.8,
    metrics: {
        coherence_score: 0.75,      // Inter-paragraph logical flow
        transition_quality: 0.7,    // Quality of connecting phrases
        hierarchy_clarity: 0.8      // Clear section/subsection structure
    }
}

item completeness_goal = Goal.new("Cover all required topics comprehensively") {
    success_threshold: 0.9,
    keywords: ["introduction", "methodology", "results", "conclusion"],
    metrics: {
        topic_coverage: 0.95,       // Percentage of required topics covered
        depth_adequacy: 0.8,        // Sufficient detail for each topic
        balance_score: 0.7          // Even distribution of content
    }
}
```

#### Domain-Specific Goals
```turbulance
item academic_goal = Goal.new("Meet academic writing standards") {
    success_threshold: 0.85,
    domain: "academic",
    metrics: {
        citation_density: 0.15,     // Citations per paragraph
        formality_level: 0.8,       // Academic tone consistency
        evidence_support: 0.9       // Claims backed by evidence
    }
}

item technical_goal = Goal.new("Create accurate technical documentation") {
    success_threshold: 0.9,
    domain: "technical",
    metrics: {
        accuracy_score: 0.95,       // Factual correctness
        completeness: 0.85,         // All necessary details included
        reproducibility: 0.9        // Others can follow instructions
    }
}
```

## Goal Tracking and Progress Evaluation

### Automatic Progress Tracking

```turbulance
// Goals automatically track progress as you write
funxn track_progress(goal: Goal, text: TextUnit) -> ProgressUpdate:
    item progress = goal.evaluate_progress(text)
    
    // Update goal metrics
    goal.current_progress = progress.overall_score
    goal.last_updated = now()
    
    // Identify areas needing attention
    item gaps = progress.identify_gaps()
    
    return ProgressUpdate {
        score: progress.overall_score,
        improvements: gaps,
        suggestions: generate_suggestions(goal, gaps),
        next_actions: prioritize_actions(gaps)
    }
```

### Progress Evaluation Metrics

```turbulance
// Real-time progress evaluation
considering goal in active_goals:
    item current_score = goal.evaluate_against(current_text)
    
    given current_score >= goal.success_threshold:
        goal.mark_completed()
        trigger_celebration()
    
    given current_score < goal.success_threshold * 0.5:
        suggest_major_revision(goal)
    
    given stagnation_detected(goal):
        offer_alternative_approaches(goal)
```

## Goal Integration with Text Processing

### Goal-Aware Text Operations

```turbulance
// Operations can consider active goals
funxn goal_aware_enhancement(text: TextUnit, goals: Array<Goal>) -> TextUnit:
    item enhanced = text
    
    considering goal in goals where goal.is_active():
        given goal.requires_clarity() && readability_score(enhanced) < goal.metrics.readability_score:
            enhanced = simplify_sentences(enhanced)
        
        given goal.requires_formality() && formality_level(enhanced) < goal.metrics.formality_level:
            enhanced = formalize(enhanced, goal.domain)
        
        given goal.requires_citations() && citation_density(enhanced) < goal.metrics.citation_density:
            enhanced = suggest_citations(enhanced, goal.domain)
    
    return enhanced
```

### Proposition-Goal Integration

```turbulance
// Goals can drive proposition evaluation
proposition ContentQuality:
    motion Clarity("Content should be clear to target audience")
    motion Completeness("All required topics should be covered")
    motion Accuracy("Information should be factually correct")
    
    // Evaluate against active goals
    considering goal in active_goals:
        within text:
            given goal.targets_clarity() && readability_score() >= goal.metrics.readability_score:
                support Clarity with_weight(goal.priority.weight())
            
            given goal.targets_completeness() && topic_coverage() >= goal.metrics.topic_coverage:
                support Completeness with_weight(goal.priority.weight())
            
            given goal.targets_accuracy() && fact_check_score() >= goal.metrics.accuracy_score:
                support Accuracy with_weight(goal.priority.weight())
```

## Hierarchical Goals and Sub-Goals

### Goal Decomposition

```turbulance
// Break complex goals into manageable sub-goals
item dissertation_goal = Goal.new("Complete PhD dissertation") {
    success_threshold: 0.9,
    deadline: "2024-06-01"
}

// Add sub-goals
dissertation_goal.add_sub_goal(Goal.new("Literature review chapter") {
    success_threshold: 0.85,
    deadline: "2024-02-15",
    metrics: {
        source_count: 150,
        synthesis_quality: 0.8,
        critical_analysis: 0.75
    }
})

        reproducibility: 0.95,
        statistical_rigor: 0.9,
        ethical_compliance: 1.0
    }
})

dissertation_goal.add_sub_goal(Goal.new("Results analysis") {
    success_threshold: 0.85,
    deadline: "2024-04-30",
    metrics: {
        data_completeness: 0.95,
        visualization_quality: 0.8,
        statistical_significance: 0.9
    }
})
```

### Sub-Goal Dependencies

```turbulance

dissertation_goal.define_dependencies([
    Dependency("Literature review", "precedes", "Methodology"),
    Dependency("Methodology", "precedes", "Results analysis"),
    Dependency("Results analysis", "precedes", "Discussion"),
    Dependency("All chapters", "required_for", "Final draft")
])

// Automatic dependency checking
funxn check_dependencies(goal: Goal) -> DependencyStatus:
    considering sub_goal in goal.sub_goals:
        item dependencies = goal.get_dependencies(sub_goal)
        
        considering dependency in dependencies:
            given not dependency.is_satisfied():
                return DependencyStatus.Blocked(dependency)
    
    return DependencyStatus.Ready
```

## Adaptive Goal Management

        // Adjust based on progress velocity
        item velocity = goal.calculate_velocity()
        given velocity < 0.5 && goal.deadline.is_approaching():
            goal.suggest_scope_reduction()
            goal.increase_support_level()
        
        // Adjust based on domain expertise
        given context.user_expertise < goal.required_expertise:
            goal.add_learning_objectives()
            goal.increase_explanation_requirements()
        
        // Adjust based on audience feedback
        given has_audience_feedback(goal):
            item feedback = get_audience_feedback(goal)
            goal.adapt_to_feedback(feedback)
    
    return adapted_goals
```

### Goal Conflict Resolution

```turbulance
// Handle conflicting goals automatically
funxn resolve_goal_conflicts(goals: Array<Goal>) -> ConflictResolution:
    item conflicts = detect_conflicts(goals)
    
    considering conflict in conflicts:
        given conflict.type == ConflictType.Priority:
            // Resolve by priority and deadline
            item resolution = resolve_by_priority(conflict.goals)
            
        given conflict.type == ConflictType.Resource:
            // Resolve by resource optimization
            item resolution = optimize_resource_allocation(conflict.goals)
            
        given conflict.type == ConflictType.Logical:
            // Resolve by logical consistency
            item resolution = ensure_logical_consistency(conflict.goals)
    
    return ConflictResolution(resolutions)
```

## Goal-Driven Writing Assistance

funxn generate_goal_suggestions(text: TextUnit, goals: Array<Goal>) -> Array<Suggestion>:
    item suggestions = []
    
    considering goal in goals where goal.needs_attention():
        item gap_analysis = goal.analyze_gaps(text)
        
        given gap_analysis.has_clarity_gap():
            suggestions.add(Suggestion.ClarityImprovement {
                target: gap_analysis.unclear_sections,
                action: "Simplify complex sentences",
                expected_impact: 0.15
            })
        
        given gap_analysis.has_structure_gap():
            suggestions.add(Suggestion.StructureImprovement {
                target: gap_analysis.disorganized_sections,
                action: "Add transitional phrases",

            })
        
        given gap_analysis.has_completeness_gap():
            suggestions.add(Suggestion.ContentAddition {
                target: gap_analysis.missing_topics,
                action: "Add section on {topic}",
                expected_impact: 0.2
            })
    
    return prioritize_suggestions(suggestions)
```
