# Evidence Rectification Framework for Biological Molecules

## Scientific Background and Purpose

Hegel addresses a fundamental challenge in molecular biology research: the validation and rectification of molecular identities when evidence from different experimental techniques conflicts or lacks confidence. In biological research, correctly identifying molecules (proteins, metabolites, nucleic acids) is critical, yet different experimental techniques often produce contradictory evidence.

The framework applies metacognitive principles to evaluate and reconcile evidence from multiple sources using both computational algorithms and AI-guided analysis. This approach is particularly valuable for:

1. **Proteomics research**: Where mass spectrometry data may contain ambiguities in peptide identification
2. **Metabolomics**: Where similar molecular structures make definitive identification challenging
3. **Multi-omics integration**: Where evidence from genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics must be reconciled
4. **Pathway analysis**: Where molecule identity impacts the interpretation of biological pathways

## Core Scientific Approach

Hegel's central innovation is its evidence rectification methodology, which combines:

### Hybrid Fuzzy-Bayesian Evidence Networks

**Revolutionary Approach**: Hegel addresses a fundamental flaw in traditional biological evidence systems - the treatment of inherently continuous, uncertain biological evidence as binary classifications. Our hybrid fuzzy-Bayesian system recognizes that biological evidence exists on a spectrum of certainty and implements sophisticated mathematical frameworks to handle this reality.

#### Fuzzy Logic Integration

The framework employs **fuzzy membership functions** to represent evidence confidence as continuous degrees of membership across linguistic variables:

- **Triangular Functions**: For evidence with clear boundaries (e.g., sequence similarity thresholds)
- **Gaussian Functions**: For normally distributed evidence (e.g., spectral matching scores)
- **Trapezoidal Functions**: For evidence with plateau regions of high confidence
- **Sigmoid Functions**: For evidence with sharp transitions between confidence levels

Linguistic variables include: `very_low`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `very_high` with continuous membership degrees rather than binary classifications.

#### Enhanced Bayesian Networks

The mathematical foundation combines traditional Bayesian inference with fuzzy logic:

```
P(identity|evidence) = ∫ μ(evidence) × P(evidence|identity) × P(identity) dμ
```

Where:
- μ(evidence) represents the fuzzy membership degree of the evidence
- P(evidence|identity) is the likelihood weighted by fuzzy confidence
- P(identity) incorporates network-based priors from evidence relationships
- The integral accounts for uncertainty propagation through the fuzzy-Bayesian network

#### Evidence Network Prediction

The system builds **evidence relationship networks** that can predict missing evidence based on partial observations:

1. **Network Learning**: Automatically discovers relationships between evidence types
2. **Missing Evidence Prediction**: Uses network topology to infer likely evidence values
3. **Confidence Propagation**: Spreads uncertainty through evidence networks
4. **Temporal Decay**: Models evidence reliability degradation over time (30-day decay function)

### Graph-based Relationship Analysis

Molecular relationships (metabolic pathways, protein-protein interactions, enzyme-substrate relationships) are modeled as graphs in Neo4j, allowing:

1. **Context-based validation**: Evaluating molecular identities within their biological context
2. **Network-based inference**: Using graph algorithms to infer likely identities based on network topology
3. **Pathway coherence analysis**: Ensuring that identified molecules form coherent biological pathways

The graph model uses specialized algorithms including:
- Cypher-based path analysis for reactome pathways
- PageRank-derived algorithms to identify central molecules in networks
- Community detection to identify functional modules

### AI-guided Evidence Rectification

Hegel implements a metacognitive AI system using LLMs to guide evidence rectification when traditional algorithms reach confidence thresholds below acceptable levels. This system:

1. Evaluates confidence scores from computational analysis
2. Identifies patterns in evidence conflicts
3. Applies domain-specific heuristics to resolve conflicts
4. Generates hypotheses for further experimental validation
5. Explains reasoning in human-interpretable format

The LLM component doesn't merely generate outputs, but is designed to reason through evidence in a stepwise manner using a form of chain-of-thought reasoning adapted specifically for molecular evidence evaluation.

## Architecture Components

The Hegel framework consists of several key components:

1. **Rust Core Engine**: High-performance fuzzy-Bayesian evidence processing engine with advanced mathematical frameworks.
2. **Federated Learning System**: Decentralized evidence sharing and collaborative learning without data movement, inspired by [Bloodhound](https://github.com/fullscreen-triangle/bloodhound).
3. **Specialized Intelligence Modules**:
   - **Mzekezeke**: Python machine learning workhorse for predictive modeling and pattern recognition
   - **Diggiden**: Adversarial system that persistently probes for network vulnerabilities and evidence flaws
   - **Hatata**: Markov decision system with utility functions for probabilistic state transitions
   - **Spectacular**: Specialized module for handling extraordinary data and anomalous findings
   - **Nicotine**: Context preservation system that validates understanding through machine-readable puzzles
4. **Backend (Python/FastAPI)**: API implementation for data processing and analysis with fuzzy evidence integration.
5. **Metacognitive AI System**: AI-guided evidence rectification using LLM integration.
6. **Graph Database**: Neo4j database for storing molecular relationship data (reactome, interactome).
7. **Frontend (React)**: Interactive user interface for visualizing and interacting with molecular data and fuzzy evidence networks.
8. **Authentication System**: Role-based JWT authentication for secure access control.
9. **Deployment Pipeline**: Containerized deployment with Docker and Nginx for production environments.

### 1. Rust Core Engine - Fuzzy-Bayesian Evidence Processing

The high-performance Rust core engine implements the revolutionary fuzzy-Bayesian evidence system:

#### Fuzzy Logic Framework
- **Membership Functions**: Triangular, Trapezoidal, Gaussian, and Sigmoid functions for modeling evidence uncertainty
- **Linguistic Variables**: Continuous fuzzy variables (`very_low`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `very_high`) replacing binary classifications
- **Fuzzy Operations**: T-norms, S-norms, and fuzzy implication operators for evidence combination
- **Defuzzification**: Centroid and weighted average methods for crisp output generation

#### Bayesian Network Integration
- **FuzzyBayesianNetwork**: Advanced network structure combining fuzzy logic with probabilistic reasoning
- **Evidence Nodes**: Represent individual pieces of evidence with fuzzy membership degrees
- **Relationship Edges**: Model dependencies between evidence types with fuzzy rules
- **Posterior Calculation**: Hybrid fuzzy-Bayesian inference for enhanced confidence scoring

#### Network Learning and Prediction
- **Evidence Relationship Discovery**: Automatically learns relationships between evidence types
- **Missing Evidence Prediction**: Predicts likely evidence values based on network structure and partial observations
- **Confidence Propagation**: Spreads uncertainty through evidence networks using fuzzy inference
- **Temporal Modeling**: 30-day exponential decay function for evidence reliability over time

#### Granular Objective Functions
- **MaximizeConfidence**: Optimize for highest evidence confidence
- **MinimizeUncertainty**: Reduce uncertainty bounds in evidence assessment
- **MaximizeConsistency**: Ensure coherent evidence across multiple sources
- **MinimizeConflicts**: Resolve contradictory evidence through fuzzy reasoning
- **MaximizeNetworkCoherence**: Optimize entire evidence network structure

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Zero-copy Operations**: Efficient memory management for large evidence datasets
- **Parallel Processing**: Multi-threaded fuzzy inference and network operations
- **SIMD Instructions**: Vectorized mathematical operations for fuzzy computations
- **Memory Pool Allocation**: Optimized memory usage for real-time evidence processing

The Rust implementation provides 10-100x performance improvements over traditional Python-based evidence processing while maintaining mathematical precision and scientific rigor.

### 2. Federated Learning System - Decentralized Evidence Collaboration

**Inspired by [Bloodhound](https://github.com/fullscreen-triangle/bloodhound)**: Hegel addresses the critical challenge that most biological evidence is distributed across institutions and often inaccessible due to privacy, regulatory, or competitive concerns. Our federated learning approach enables collaborative evidence enhancement without requiring data movement.

#### Local-First Evidence Processing

Following Bloodhound's principles, Hegel implements a **local-first architecture** where:

- **Data Never Leaves Source**: All sensitive biological data remains at the originating institution
- **Pattern Sharing Only**: Only learned patterns, model updates, and statistical insights are shared
- **Zero-Configuration Setup**: Automatic resource detection and optimization without manual configuration
- **Peer-to-Peer Communication**: Direct lab-to-lab communication when specific data sharing is absolutely necessary

#### Federated Fuzzy-Bayesian Learning

The system extends traditional federated learning to handle fuzzy evidence:

```
Local Institution i:
1. Process local evidence with fuzzy-Bayesian engine
2. Extract fuzzy membership patterns and relationship weights
3. Generate local model updates (Δθᵢ)
4. Share only aggregated fuzzy parameters

Global Aggregation:
θ_global = Σᵢ (nᵢ/N) × Δθᵢ

Where:
- nᵢ = number of evidence samples at institution i
- N = total evidence samples across all institutions
- Δθᵢ = local fuzzy-Bayesian model updates
```

#### Privacy-Preserving Evidence Networks

- **Differential Privacy**: Noise injection to protect individual evidence contributions
- **Secure Aggregation**: Cryptographic protocols for safe model parameter sharing
- **Federated Graph Learning**: Collaborative evidence network construction without exposing local topology
- **Homomorphic Encryption**: Computation on encrypted fuzzy membership functions

#### Distributed Evidence Prediction

When evidence is missing locally, the system can:

1. **Query Federated Network**: Request evidence predictions from the global model
2. **Uncertainty Propagation**: Maintain uncertainty bounds across federated predictions
3. **Consensus Building**: Aggregate predictions from multiple institutions with confidence weighting
4. **Local Validation**: Validate federated predictions against local evidence patterns

#### Automatic Resource Management

Adopting Bloodhound's zero-configuration approach:

```python
class FederatedEvidenceManager:
    """Zero-configuration federated evidence processing"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        # Automatic detection - no manual setup required
        self.local_resources = self._detect_local_capabilities()
        self.network_peers = self._discover_available_peers()
        
    async def process_evidence_collaboratively(self, local_evidence):
        """
        Process evidence with federated enhancement
        Only shares patterns, never raw data
        """
        # Process locally first
        local_patterns = await self._extract_local_patterns(local_evidence)
        
        # Enhance with federated knowledge (optional)
        if self._should_use_federated_enhancement():
            enhanced_patterns = await self._federated_enhancement(local_patterns)
            return self._merge_patterns(local_patterns, enhanced_patterns)
        
        return local_patterns
```

#### Conversational Federated Analysis

Extending Bloodhound's natural language interface for federated evidence:

```
Researcher: "Can you analyze my metabolomics data and see if other labs have similar patterns?"

Hegel: I've analyzed your local data and found 3 significant metabolite clusters. 
I can enhance this analysis by learning from patterns shared by 12 other 
institutions (without accessing their raw data).

Your local analysis shows:
- 157 significantly changed features
- Strong correlation with treatment time
- Potential lipid metabolism pathway enrichment

Federated enhancement suggests:
- Similar patterns observed in 8/12 institutions
- Additional pathway: amino acid metabolism (confidence: 0.73)
- Recommended validation: measure branched-chain amino acids

Would you like me to request specific pattern validation from the network?
```

#### Network Topology and Discovery

- **Automatic Peer Discovery**: Zero-configuration discovery of compatible Hegel instances
- **Reputation System**: Trust scoring based on evidence quality and validation accuracy
- **Dynamic Network Formation**: Adaptive network topology based on research domains and evidence types
- **Graceful Degradation**: Full functionality even when operating in isolation

#### Federated Evidence Quality Assurance

- **Cross-Validation**: Federated validation of evidence quality across institutions
- **Outlier Detection**: Collaborative identification of anomalous evidence patterns
- **Consensus Scoring**: Multi-institutional confidence scoring for evidence reliability
- **Temporal Synchronization**: Coordinated evidence decay modeling across the network

# Hegel: Evidence Rectification Framework for Biological Molecules

## Scientific Background and Purpose

Hegel addresses a fundamental challenge in molecular biology research: the validation and rectification of molecular identities when evidence from different experimental techniques conflicts or lacks confidence. In biological research, correctly identifying molecules (proteins, metabolites, nucleic acids) is critical, yet different experimental techniques often produce contradictory evidence.

The framework applies metacognitive principles to evaluate and reconcile evidence from multiple sources using both computational algorithms and AI-guided analysis. This approach is particularly valuable for:

1. **Proteomics research**: Where mass spectrometry data may contain ambiguities in peptide identification
2. **Metabolomics**: Where similar molecular structures make definitive identification challenging
3. **Multi-omics integration**: Where evidence from genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics must be reconciled
4. **Pathway analysis**: Where molecule identity impacts the interpretation of biological pathways

## Core Scientific Approach

Hegel's central innovation is its evidence rectification methodology, which combines:

### Hybrid Fuzzy-Bayesian Evidence Networks

**Revolutionary Approach**: Hegel addresses a fundamental flaw in traditional biological evidence systems - the treatment of inherently continuous, uncertain biological evidence as binary classifications. Our hybrid fuzzy-Bayesian system recognizes that biological evidence exists on a spectrum of certainty and implements sophisticated mathematical frameworks to handle this reality.

#### Fuzzy Logic Integration

The framework employs **fuzzy membership functions** to represent evidence confidence as continuous degrees of membership across linguistic variables:

- **Triangular Functions**: For evidence with clear boundaries (e.g., sequence similarity thresholds)
- **Gaussian Functions**: For normally distributed evidence (e.g., spectral matching scores)
- **Trapezoidal Functions**: For evidence with plateau regions of high confidence
- **Sigmoid Functions**: For evidence with sharp transitions between confidence levels

Linguistic variables include: `very_low`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `very_high` with continuous membership degrees rather than binary classifications.

#### Enhanced Bayesian Networks

The mathematical foundation combines traditional Bayesian inference with fuzzy logic:

```
P(identity|evidence) = ∫ μ(evidence) × P(evidence|identity) × P(identity) dμ
```

Where:
- μ(evidence) represents the fuzzy membership degree of the evidence
- P(evidence|identity) is the likelihood weighted by fuzzy confidence
- P(identity) incorporates network-based priors from evidence relationships
- The integral accounts for uncertainty propagation through the fuzzy-Bayesian network

#### Evidence Network Prediction

The system builds **evidence relationship networks** that can predict missing evidence based on partial observations:

1. **Network Learning**: Automatically discovers relationships between evidence types
2. **Missing Evidence Prediction**: Uses network topology to infer likely evidence values
3. **Confidence Propagation**: Spreads uncertainty through evidence networks
4. **Temporal Decay**: Models evidence reliability degradation over time (30-day decay function)

### Graph-based Relationship Analysis

Molecular relationships (metabolic pathways, protein-protein interactions, enzyme-substrate relationships) are modeled as graphs in Neo4j, allowing:

1. **Context-based validation**: Evaluating molecular identities within their biological context
2. **Network-based inference**: Using graph algorithms to infer likely identities based on network topology
3. **Pathway coherence analysis**: Ensuring that identified molecules form coherent biological pathways

The graph model uses specialized algorithms including:
- Cypher-based path analysis for reactome pathways
- PageRank-derived algorithms to identify central molecules in networks
- Community detection to identify functional modules

### AI-guided Evidence Rectification

Hegel implements a metacognitive AI system using LLMs to guide evidence rectification when traditional algorithms reach confidence thresholds below acceptable levels. This system:

1. Evaluates confidence scores from computational analysis
2. Identifies patterns in evidence conflicts
3. Applies domain-specific heuristics to resolve conflicts
4. Generates hypotheses for further experimental validation
5. Explains reasoning in human-interpretable format

The LLM component doesn't merely generate outputs, but is designed to reason through evidence in a stepwise manner using a form of chain-of-thought reasoning adapted specifically for molecular evidence evaluation.

## Architecture Components

The Hegel framework consists of several key components:

1. **Rust Core Engine**: High-performance fuzzy-Bayesian evidence processing engine with advanced mathematical frameworks.
2. **Federated Learning System**: Decentralized evidence sharing and collaborative learning without data movement, inspired by [Bloodhound](https://github.com/fullscreen-triangle/bloodhound).
3. **Specialized Intelligence Modules**:
   - **Mzekezeke**: Python machine learning workhorse for predictive modeling and pattern recognition
   - **Diggiden**: Adversarial system that persistently probes for network vulnerabilities and evidence flaws
   - **Hatata**: Markov decision system with utility functions for probabilistic state transitions
   - **Spectacular**: Specialized module for handling extraordinary data and anomalous findings
   - **Nicotine**: Context preservation system that validates understanding through machine-readable puzzles
4. **Backend (Python/FastAPI)**: API implementation for data processing and analysis with fuzzy evidence integration.
5. **Metacognitive AI System**: AI-guided evidence rectification using LLM integration.
6. **Graph Database**: Neo4j database for storing molecular relationship data (reactome, interactome).
7. **Frontend (React)**: Interactive user interface for visualizing and interacting with molecular data and fuzzy evidence networks.
8. **Authentication System**: Role-based JWT authentication for secure access control.
9. **Deployment Pipeline**: Containerized deployment with Docker and Nginx for production environments.

### 1. Rust Core Engine - Fuzzy-Bayesian Evidence Processing

The high-performance Rust core engine implements the revolutionary fuzzy-Bayesian evidence system:

#### Fuzzy Logic Framework
- **Membership Functions**: Triangular, Trapezoidal, Gaussian, and Sigmoid functions for modeling evidence uncertainty
- **Linguistic Variables**: Continuous fuzzy variables (`very_low`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `very_high`) replacing binary classifications

- **Defuzzification**: Centroid and weighted average methods for crisp output generation

#### Bayesian Network Integration
- **FuzzyBayesianNetwork**: Advanced network structure combining fuzzy logic with probabilistic reasoning
- **Evidence Nodes**: Represent individual pieces of evidence with fuzzy membership degrees
- **Relationship Edges**: Model dependencies between evidence types with fuzzy rules
- **Posterior Calculation**: Hybrid fuzzy-Bayesian inference for enhanced confidence scoring

#### Network Learning and Prediction

- **Missing Evidence Prediction**: Predicts likely evidence values based on network structure and partial observations
- **Confidence Propagation**: Spreads uncertainty through evidence networks using fuzzy inference
- **Temporal Modeling**: 30-day exponential decay function for evidence reliability over time

#### Granular Objective Functions
- **MaximizeConfidence**: Optimize for highest evidence confidence
- **MinimizeUncertainty**: Reduce uncertainty bounds in evidence assessment
- **MaximizeConsistency**: Ensure coherent evidence across multiple sources
- **MinimizeConflicts**: Resolve contradictory evidence through fuzzy reasoning
- **MaximizeNetworkCoherence**: Optimize entire evidence network structure

- **SIMD Instructions**: Vectorized mathematical operations for fuzzy computations
- **Memory Pool Allocation**: Optimized memory usage for real-time evidence processing

The Rust implementation provides 10-100x performance improvements over traditional Python-based evidence processing while maintaining mathematical precision and scientific rigor.

### 2. Federated Learning System - Decentralized Evidence Collaboration

**Inspired by [Bloodhound](https://github.com/fullscreen-triangle/bloodhound)**: Hegel addresses the critical challenge that most biological evidence is distributed across institutions and often inaccessible due to privacy, regulatory, or competitive concerns. Our federated learning approach enables collaborative evidence enhancement without requiring data movement.

#### Local-First Evidence Processing

Following Bloodhound's principles, Hegel implements a **local-first architecture** where:

- **Data Never Leaves Source**: All sensitive biological data remains at the originating institution
- **Pattern Sharing Only**: Only learned patterns, model updates, and statistical insights are shared
- **Zero-Configuration Setup**: Automatic resource detection and optimization without manual configuration
- **Peer-to-Peer Communication**: Direct lab-to-lab communication when specific data sharing is absolutely necessary

#### Federated Fuzzy-Bayesian Learning

The system extends traditional federated learning to handle fuzzy evidence:

```
Local Institution i:
1. Process local evidence with fuzzy-Bayesian engine
2. Extract fuzzy membership patterns and relationship weights
3. Generate local model updates (Δθᵢ)
4. Share only aggregated fuzzy parameters

Global Aggregation:
θ_global = Σᵢ (nᵢ/N) × Δθᵢ

Where:
- nᵢ = number of evidence samples at institution i
- N = total evidence samples across all institutions
- Δθᵢ = local fuzzy-Bayesian model updates
```

#### Privacy-Preserving Evidence Networks

- **Differential Privacy**: Noise injection to protect individual evidence contributions
- **Secure Aggregation**: Cryptographic protocols for safe model parameter sharing
- **Federated Graph Learning**: Collaborative evidence network construction without exposing local topology
- **Homomorphic Encryption**: Computation on encrypted fuzzy membership functions

#### Distributed Evidence Prediction

When evidence is missing locally, the system can:

1. **Query Federated Network**: Request evidence predictions from the global model
2. **Uncertainty Propagation**: Maintain uncertainty bounds across federated predictions
3. **Consensus Building**: Aggregate predictions from multiple institutions with confidence weighting
4. **Local Validation**: Validate federated predictions against local evidence patterns

#### Automatic Resource Management

Adopting Bloodhound's zero-configuration approach:

```python
class FederatedEvidenceManager:
    """Zero-configuration federated evidence processing"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        # Automatic detection - no manual setup required
        self.local_resources = self._detect_local_capabilities()
        self.network_peers = self._discover_available_peers()
        
    async def process_evidence_collaboratively(self, local_evidence):
        """
        Process evidence with federated enhancement
        Only shares patterns, never raw data
        """
        # Process locally first
        local_patterns = await self._extract_local_patterns(local_evidence)
        
        # Enhance with federated knowledge (optional)
        if self._should_use_federated_enhancement():
            enhanced_patterns = await self._federated_enhancement(local_patterns)
            return self._merge_patterns(local_patterns, enhanced_patterns)
        
        return local_patterns
```

#### Conversational Federated Analysis

Extending Bloodhound's natural language interface for federated evidence:

```
Researcher: "Can you analyze my metabolomics data and see if other labs have similar patterns?"

Hegel: I've analyzed your local data and found 3 significant metabolite clusters. 
I can enhance this analysis by learning from patterns shared by 12 other 
institutions (without accessing their raw data).

Your local analysis shows:
- 157 significantly changed features
- Strong correlation with treatment time
- Potential lipid metabolism pathway enrichment

Federated enhancement suggests:
- Similar patterns observed in 8/12 institutions
- Additional pathway: amino acid metabolism (confidence: 0.73)
- Recommended validation: measure branched-chain amino acids

Would you like me to request specific pattern validation from the network?
```

- **Automatic Peer Discovery**: Zero-configuration discovery of compatible Hegel instances
- **Reputation System**: Trust scoring based on evidence quality and validation accuracy

- **Outlier Detection**: Collaborative identification of anomalous evidence patterns
- **Consensus Scoring**: Multi-institutional confidence scoring for evidence reliability
- **Temporal Synchronization**: Coordinated evidence decay modeling across the network

## Key Features

### Federated Evidence Collaboration

**Inspired by [Bloodhound](https://github.com/fullscreen-triangle/bloodhound)**: Hegel addresses the reality that most valuable biological evidence is distributed across institutions and often inaccessible due to privacy, regulatory, or competitive concerns. Our federated learning system enables collaborative evidence enhancement without requiring sensitive data to leave its source.

#### Key Federated Capabilities
1. **Local-First Processing**: All sensitive data remains at the originating institution
2. **Pattern-Only Sharing**: Only learned patterns and statistical insights are shared across the network
3. **Zero-Configuration Setup**: Automatic peer discovery and resource optimization
4. **Privacy-Preserving Learning**: Differential privacy and secure aggregation protocols
5. **Conversational Federated Analysis**: Natural language interface for collaborative evidence exploration
6. **Graceful Degradation**: Full functionality even when operating in isolation

### Specialized Intelligence Modules

**Five Coordinated AI Systems**: Hegel incorporates specialized intelligence modules that work in concert to create a robust, self-improving evidence processing system:

1. **[Mzekezeke](docs/mzekezeke-module.md) (ML Workhorse)**: Primary predictive engine with ensemble methods and continuous learning
2. **[Diggiden](docs/diggiden-module.md) (Adversarial System)**: Persistent vulnerability detection and robustness testing
3. **[Hatata](docs/hatata-module.md) (Markov Decision System)**: Probabilistic decision-making with utility optimization
4. **[Spectacular](docs/spectacular-module.md) (Extraordinary Handler)**: Specialized processing for anomalous and novel findings
5. **[Nicotine](docs/nicotine-module.md) (Context Preservation System)**: Prevents AI drift through validation puzzles and context monitoring

**Comprehensive Module Documentation**: [View complete module integration guide →](docs/modules-overview.md)

### Hybrid Fuzzy-Bayesian Evidence System

**Revolutionary Innovation**: Hegel's core breakthrough is the recognition that biological evidence is inherently continuous and uncertain, not binary. Our hybrid system transforms how molecular evidence is processed:

#### Fuzzy Evidence Processing
1. **Continuous Membership Functions**: Evidence confidence represented as continuous degrees across linguistic variables
2. **Multi-dimensional Uncertainty**: Captures both aleatory (natural randomness) and epistemic (knowledge) uncertainty
3. **Temporal Evidence Decay**: Models how evidence reliability decreases over time with 30-day exponential decay
4. **Uncertainty Bounds**: Provides confidence intervals for all evidence assessments

#### Evidence Network Learning
1. **Relationship Discovery**: Automatically learns how different evidence types relate to each other
2. **Missing Evidence Prediction**: Predicts likely evidence values based on partial network observations
3. **Network Coherence Optimization**: Ensures evidence networks maintain biological plausibility
4. **Confidence Propagation**: Spreads uncertainty through evidence networks using fuzzy inference rules

#### Granular Objective Functions
1. **Multi-criteria Optimization**: Simultaneously optimizes multiple evidence quality metrics
2. **Weighted Objectives**: Allows researchers to prioritize different aspects of evidence quality
3. **Dynamic Adaptation**: Objective functions adapt based on evidence type and research context
4. **Pareto Optimization**: Finds optimal trade-offs between conflicting evidence quality criteria

#### Scientific Rigor
- **Mathematical Foundation**: Grounded in fuzzy set theory and Bayesian probability
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Provides rigorous uncertainty bounds for all predictions
- **Reproducible Results**: Deterministic algorithms ensure consistent evidence processing
- **Validation Framework**: Built-in methods for validating fuzzy-Bayesian predictions

5. **Confidence recalculation**: Updating confidence based on integrated evidence
6. **Explanation generation**: Producing human-readable justification for rectification decisions

This process is designed to handle various evidence types including:
- Mass spectrometry data with varying fragmentation patterns
