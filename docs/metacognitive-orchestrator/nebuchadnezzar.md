# Nebuchadnezzar

## Hierarchical Probabilistic Electric Circuit System for Biological Simulation
Overview

Nebuchadnezzar is a high-performance, hierarchical probabilistic electric circuit simulation system designed to model intracellular electrical dynamics. Named after the ancient king who built magnificent structures, Nebuchadnezzar constructs foundational biological evidence through multi-scale electrical circuit simulation.

###  Core Philosophy
Hierarchical: Multi-scale simulation from molecular to cellular to tissue level
Probabilistic: Bayesian uncertainty quantification at every level
Electric: Focus on electrical phenomena as the foundation of biological computation
Evidence-Based: Generate foundational evidence for higher-level biological reasoning
