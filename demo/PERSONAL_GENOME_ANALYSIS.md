# Personal Genome-Coherent Intracellular Dynamics Analysis

Transform your personal genome data into actionable biological insights using the St. Stellas unified theoretical framework.

## Quick Start

### 1. Get Your Genome Data

You need your personal genome data in one of these formats:

**Option A: Direct-to-Consumer Testing**

- **23andMe**: Download your raw data file from your account
- **AncestryDNA**: Download your raw data file from your account
- **MyHeritage**: Download your raw data file

**Option B: Clinical/Research Data**

- **CSV files**: Custom format with required columns

**Option C: Whole Genome Sequencing**

- Most WGS providers can export to VCF format
- Contact your provider for file export instructions

### 2. Run Your Personal Analysis

```bash
# Basic analysis with auto-format detection
python run_personal_analysis.py --genome-file /path/to/your/genome.vcf

# Specify format explicitly
python run_personal_analysis.py --genome-file 23andme_data.txt --format 23andme

# Custom output directory
python run_personal_analysis.py --genome-file mydata.vcf --output my_results/

# Skip visualization plots (faster)

```

```

### CSV Format

Must include these columns:

- `chromosome`: Chromosome identifier
- `position`: Genomic position
- `ref_allele`: Reference allele

## Configuration

Customize your analysis by editing `personal_genome_config.json`:

```json
{
  "personalization_targets": {
    "optimize_for": [
      "energy_efficiency",
      "cognitive_performance",
      "circadian_optimization",
      "cellular_resilience"
    ]

    }
  }
}
```

## Scientific Framework

This analysis is based on the St. Stellas unified theoretical framework:

### Core Principles

1. **S-Entropy Navigation**: Problems are solved by navigating to predetermined solution coordinates rather than computational search
2. **Oscillatory Hierarchies**: Biology operates through coupled oscillations across multiple scales
3. **ATP-Constrained Dynamics**: Cellular processes are governed by energy availability, not just time
4. **Biological Maxwell Demons**: Information processing through selective molecular filtering

### Mathematical Foundation

- **ATP-constrained differential equations**: `dx/d[ATP] = f(x, [ATP], genetics)`
- **Multi-scale oscillatory coupling**: Coordination across quantum to organismal scales
- **S-entropy coordinate navigation**: Direct access to optimal biological states

## Privacy & Security

Your genetic data:

- âœ… Processed locally on your computer
- âœ… Never uploaded or transmitted anywhere
- âœ… You control all data and results
- âœ… Analysis runs offline after setup

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"File format not recognized"**

- Ensure your file has the correct extension (.vcf, .txt, .csv)
- Try specifying format explicitly: `--format vcf`

**"No variants found in known genes"**

- Your file might be missing gene annotation
- Try a different file format
- Check that your file isn't corrupted

**"Analysis takes too long"**

- Use `--no-plots` to skip visualization generation
- Consider using a subset of your data for testing

**"Memory errors"**

- Large genome files (>1GB) might need more RAM
- Try processing chromosome by chromosome

### Getting Help

1. Check the log file: `personal_genome_analysis.log`
2. Verify your file format matches the requirements
3. Try with a smaller test file first
4. Check that all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Legal Disclaimer

This analysis is for research and educational purposes only. Results should not be used for medical diagnosis or treatment decisions. Always consult with healthcare professionals for medical advice.

The analysis is based on current scientific understanding and may not reflect all genetic effects or interactions. Environmental factors, lifestyle, and other genetic variants not analyzed may significantly influence your biology.
